# Thoughts

Random ideas, observations, and half-formed thoughts.

## On Knowledge Management

I've been fascinated by [[networked-thought:::networked thought]] systems. Traditional hierarchical organization (folders, categories) feels limiting compared to the web-like nature of how we actually think.

This [[about:::portfolio experiment]] is partly about exploring that idea.

## Web Development Philosophy

Modern web development has become incredibly complex, but there's beauty in [[static-sites:::static sites]] that just work. No servers, no databases, just files that load fast.

The [[technical-details:::technical approach]] here prioritizes simplicity and performance.

## Learning in Public

There's something powerful about [[learning-in-public:::building and sharing your work]] as you go. It creates accountability and often leads to unexpected connections.

## Design Inspiration

Andy Matuschak's note interface is brilliant because:
- Multiple contexts visible simultaneously
- Non-linear navigation feels natural
- Focus on content over chrome
- [[ui-principles:::Good UI principles]] throughout

## Meta-thoughts

Writing in this system feels different than writing in a traditional editor. The link-first approach changes how I think about connections between ideas.
