# About these notes

Hi! Welcome to my portfolio notes. This is a digital garden inspired by Andy Matuschak's working notes system.

These notes are interconnected through [[wiki-links:::wiki-style links]] that create a web of knowledge. You can click on any link to open that note in a new column.

## How it works

This system uses:
- **Bi-directional linking**: Notes can reference each other
- **Multi-column interface**: Multiple notes can be open simultaneously
- **Markdown-based**: All content is written in markdown files
- **Static hosting**: The entire site is deployable to GitHub Pages

## Navigation

- Click on [[projects:::project links]] to see my work
- Explore [[thoughts:::my thoughts]] and ideas
- Learn about [[technical-details:::the technical implementation]]

You might want to start with [[what-im-working-on:::what I'm currently working on]].

## About me

This is my digital portfolio and thinking space. Feel free to explore and see how ideas connect!
